| Q7   |  Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the following operations:</br>1. Input new time</br>2. Display the time</br>3. Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the time by one second.If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour becomes 24, it is set to zero.   | [Link](46john7.c)  |
